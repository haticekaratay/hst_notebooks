    "\n",
    "Bohlin (2016; hereafter ISR [2016-03](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/documents/isrs/1603.html)) continues the work documented in ACS ISRs [2011-02](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/documents/isrs/isr1102.pdf), [2011-03](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/documents/isrs/isr1103.pdf), and [2012-01](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/documents/isrs/isr1201.pdf) by performing the most precise set of flux calibration for the HRC and WFC cameras to date. The data are comprised of ~18 orbits of the primary hot white dwarf stars G191B2B, GC153, and GD71, which are used to define the ACS flux calibration and its change over time, spanning a ~7 year period from August 2009 to March 2016. The average decline in sensitivity is 0.061% ± 0.007% per year across all filters, which differs at most by $<1\\sigma$ from the measured rate of 0.035% ± 0.037% for F850LP; therefore, the average loss rate is adopted for all WFC data taken after SM4 (2009.4). even with gain adjustments made after the revival of the ACS WFC to match post-SM4 photometry to 2002.4 epoch photometry of 47 Tuc for F606W (ACS ISR [2011-03](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/documents/isrs/isr1103.pdf)), an additional (small) shift in sensitivity by 0.997 improves the match at F606W. These adjustments range from 0.996 to 1.007 for the other filters. After applying corrections for sensitivity loss and renormalizing, the new observations and newly reprocessed data for F435W and F814W required shifts to each filter's bandpass transmission function to reduce the maximum error. Once all of the adjustments are made, the fully corrected photometry at the WFC1-1K reference point in the eight broadband filters achieves the 1% precision goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the WFC `PHOTFLAM` results of ISR [2016-03](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/documents/isrs/1603.html) with [Sirianni et al. (2005)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005PASP..117.1049S) for 2002.16 epoch reveals differences ranging from 5% smaller for F660N to 1% larger for F550M, while the eight broadband filters are 1$-$3% smaller. For the HRC, differences range from 0$-$3% smaller, except for F344N, where the new calibration is 3% larger. These differences are due mostly to changes in the CALSPEC reference spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and to a refined and expanded set of ACS observations of these standard stars."

    "* **Flux:** The average flux $F$ (units: erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ Ang$^{-1}$) over an ACS bandpass is $F=N~\\times$ `PHOTFLAM`, where $N$ is the count rate in an infinite aperture. For count rates $N_{\\mathrm{ap}}$ in a given aperture, $N=N_{\\mathrm{ap}}/EE$ where $EE$ is the fractional encircled energy. See the ACS Data Handbook and ISR 2016-03 section 7.3 for more information on aperture corrections.\n",

The Vega magnitude of a star with flux $F$ is $m_{\\mathrm{Vega}}=-2.5\\log_{10}(F/F_{\\mathrm{Vega}})$ where $F_{\\mathrm{Vega}}$ is the flux spectrum of Vega from the [CALSPEC](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/observatory/crds/calspec.html) archive.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **STMag and ABMag:** These magnitude systems differ from VegaMag in that they have an artifical reference flux for conversion to magnitude. The reference flux for STMag ($3.63\\times10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ Ang$^{-1}$) is flat in wavelength space, while the reference for ABMag ($3.63\\times10^{-20}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$) is flat in frequency space.
