    "With the installation of the ASIC to replace the CCD electronics box during Servicing Mission 4 (SM4; May 2009), the ACS/WFC detector has low-level, horizontal striping present in the bias. This striping is removed as part of the `calacs` calibration pipeline for full-frame images, however de-striping is not performed automatically for subarray data. The pixel-based CTE correction cannot be performed on data with bias striping present, therefore ACS/WFC subarray data products retrieved from [MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu) will not be CTE-corrected. However, some subarray data can be corrected for CTE, which we will illustrate below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beginning in Cycle 24 (November 2016), the ACS Team implemented new flight software that changed the way CCD subarray images are read out (see ACS ISR [2017-03](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/documents/isrs/isr1703.pdf)). This change makes it possible to apply the pixel-based CTE correction to subarray images all subarray data taken after this date. \n",
    "\n",
    "Subarray data can be calibrated, de-striped, and CTE-corrected using the `acs_destripe_plus` code within the [ACSTOOLS](https://github.com/spacetelescope/acstools) Python package. This tool can be used to calibrate ACS/WFC subarray data in the following cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 2K subarrays taken after SM4\n",
    "2. All other subarrays taken after the start of Cycle 24\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the `acs_destripe_plus` code acts as a wrapper around the `calacs` code, performing all of the calibration steps that would normally be performed (i.e., bias/dark subtraction, flat-fielding, etc.). As such, this tool is used on `*_raw.fits` files."
